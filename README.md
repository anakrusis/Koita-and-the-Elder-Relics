# Koita and the Elder Relics
Here's the source code to our [Ludum Dare 46 entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/koita-and-the-elder-relics), Koita and the Elder Relics! It was made using [LÃ–VE 11.3](https://www.love2d.org/) and also uses the libraries [Simple Tiled Implementation](https://github.com/karai17/Simple-Tiled-Implementation) and [Bump](https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua). The maps were made in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and the Tiled source files (.tmx) and exported .lua files are present for map editing. The tiles and other textures were made in [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/).

To run it from source, just drag and drop the folder containing all the source files on your love.exe file!
